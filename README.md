### **Design Hypothesis**<br>
For my prototype 3, I wanted to explore difficulty in video games. What makes a game difficult? Unfairness? Lack of skills and understanding? These are viable reasons for what makes video games hard, so I decided to use this prototype to explore difficulties that would seem fair. I wanted to make an extremely difficult game that is easy to understand but hard to master. To accomplish this, I set out to implement one gameplay mechanic for my prototype and create a hard-to-navigate level around the core mechanic. I purposely made the prototype challenging but added elements to make the game seem fair. Through the playtest, I hope my game is seen as challenging but possible rather than frustrating and unplayable.
