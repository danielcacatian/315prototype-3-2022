# HOOKSHOT - 315prototype-3-2022
## REVISED DESIGN JOURNAL
### **Revised Hypothesis**<br>
I've learned that to make a video game seem both fair and challenging, you cannot have any surprises. In order for the game to be fair, the player should be able to know about the fundamentals of your game prior to the parts of the game that are purposely difficult. Otherwise, the game would appear to be unfair at first. When the players first know the gameplay mechanics, elements and limits, they naturally attempt to problem-solve through challenging levels with the knowledge they have at hand. When they fail, they think of another technique to try to conquer the obstacle. When they don't receive prior knowledge, they're faced with something that appears impossible, and they become discouraged to try again. I enjoy playing difficult games, but at the same time, I want to let players know that my prototype iteration is indeed possible, so I changed it to introduce the players' tools and mechanics. Afterwards, it is up to them to muster the courage and beat the hard level I designed through trial and error.

### **(New) Feedback & Reflection**<br>
Here is the final feedback compilation from my iterative prototype (Prototype 3). The culmination of feedback will dictate the outcome of my final prototype design. Here is what I've learned from the playtesters and what I intend to do with their information.

**Core Mechanic**<br>
Unfortunately, I was not able to fix one of the major issues in my prototype for the iterative version, which was the grapple hook mechanic. The issue was that the grapple hook mechanic would feel irresponsive when it shouldn't have. Thankfully, one of the playtesters solved this issue. The reason why the grapple hook mechanic was irresponsive at times is because the hook would accidentally collide with the fire point (the gun) upon firing (Left-Clicking) from time to time. The issue was easily resolved by removing the collision on the gun that shoots the rope. Now, the core mechanic feels a lot more responsive, and when you miss, it feels more like it is because you didn't aim properly or are not correctly positioned to grapple onto the surface, unlike before, where the grapple felt like it was luck-based.

**Game Elements**<br>
Before, the UI elements of my game were difficult to understand, mainly the max range. I decided to fix this issue by implementing a crosshair element that dictates the mouse position while showcasing the player's max grapple range. With this new change, the playtesters found the max range element clearer, based on their feedback. Since there is no need for further improvements, I've decided to keep the same game element for the max range from my iterative to the final. Additionally, I will also keep some text instructions to ensure that all the game elements are concise to prevent confusion.

**Difficulty**<br>
In my original prototype, I purposely made it difficult to accomplish. In my iterative prototype, I left the same difficulty and let my playtesters rate it. Based on their answers, I would then redesign the level and make it easier from the start and then progressively more difficult towards the end. I plan on making it unforgivingly hard because the level design will most likely be short. However, I do plan on making it fair by letting the player save themselves during falls.

**Conclusion**<br>
The iterative playtesters have dictated the outcome of my final design. I will keep certain elements and transition them to fit the final game while also changing and adjusting things based on the playtesters' feedback. Additionally, I will also be adding assets to decorate the prototype to make it look like a legitimate game.

**Final Improvements/Adjustments**<br>
* Redesign the level (progressively difficult)
* Fix the grapple hook mechanic (remove collision with fire point object)
* Populate the game with assets (decorate the level)

## ORIGINAL DESIGN JOURNAL
### **Design Hypothesis**<br>
For my prototype 3, I wanted to explore difficulty in video games. What makes a game difficult? Unfairness? Lack of skills and understanding? These are viable reasons for what makes video games hard, so I decided to use this prototype to explore difficulties that would seem fair. I wanted to make an extremely difficult game that is easy to understand but hard to master. To accomplish this, I set out to implement one gameplay mechanic for my prototype and create a hard-to-navigate level around the core mechanic. I purposely made the prototype challenging but added elements to make the game seem fair. Through the playtest, I hope my game is seen as challenging but possible rather than frustrating and unplayable.

### **Feedback & Reflection**<br>
For my third and last prototype, I wanted to explore difficulty in video games. I created a game with one core gameplay mechanic and centred the game around it. The playtest feedback taught me that difficulty shouldn't come from unfairness or a player's lack of skill. Instead, it should come from the player's honest mistakes during gameplay. Thanks to the playtest feedback, I realized the errors I have in my prototype that give off the wrong impression of difficulty.

**Core Mechanic**<br>
My prototype has only one core mechanic, which is the grapple hook. The grappling hook allows you to stick onto surfaces. With this mechanic, you use it to climb up. However, this mechanic is sometimes irresponsive due to the repetitive use of the grapple hook button (Left-Click HOLD). When you let go, the player falls and has to grapple onto the next wall before they fall back down to the ground. The goal is to climb up. The rapid use of the Left-Click causes the grapple hook mechanic to become irresponsive at times because it involves clicking/holding and letting go of it then clicking/holding once again. All playtesters felt this issue. However, there is a workaround for this issue, and it is by using left and right movement keys during grappling. Even with this method, it still shouldn't be an intended way of playing, especially since there is no clear indication that this method exists. The player should be able to navigate the game with just the mouse button, so I need to fix this issue.

**Game Elements**<br>
Players need to be able to understand game elements at first glance. In my prototype, there is a circle to indicate the max range the player can grapple, but most playtesters weren't able to understand it until later during gameplay. I should make it more apparent so that the players immediately understand their max range once they start playing.

**Difficulty**<br>
I intentionally made the level design difficult because I wanted to grasp the insanely challenging genre of video games. Playtesters did indeed find it difficult, but fair because of the ability to be able to save yourself from falling. It was an intended idea, however, there were external forces such as the core mechanic not being responsive that made the game increasingly difficult, which is not the intended way of adding difficulty. I intend on making my game challenging in a fair manner where all players can beat it by progressively mastering the core mechanic.

**Conclusion**<br>
I was able to achieve the difficulty I wanted in my prototype, but for mainly the wrong reasons. I need to make the difficulty stem strictly from within the level design instead of faulty controls. I was able to learn this from watching my live playtester struggle and discourage herself because she is not skillful in video games. Thankfully, my teacher stated that "it is never the player's fault but the game designer's." He was completely right, so I plan on making sure that, in the end, it is really no one's fault, but the player's simple mistakes during gameplay. Additionally, it might help players to first introduce the gameplay mechanics before dropping them into a hard level.

**Improvements**<br>
* Make game elements (i.e. grapple range) more apparent
* Fix core gameplay mechanic
* Introduce gameplay mechanics (tutorial)
* Add more mechanics/obstacles to prevent stale gameplay
